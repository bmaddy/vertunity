# Vertunity

Some sample code for our National Day of Civic Hacking group.

## Usage

Install leiningen

Run this to make stuff happen:
```bash
lein repl
```

```clojure
(use 'vertunity.core)
(def words (all-words "http://doitgreen.org/"))
(spit "doitgreen.org.html" (build-page (take 100 (reverse (sort-by second (frequencies words))))))
```

There are some example outputs in the root directory.
If you can't see any words after creating a page, you probably have to play with the 'printMultiplier' value in the javascript. It seems to happen when the weights get really big on large sites.
